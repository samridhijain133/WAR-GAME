# WAR-GAME
War is a card game played between 2 players. War uses a standard 52-card deck. Cards are shuffled before the match. Deal cards back and forth so that each player has 26 cards. Do not look at your cards.  Flip cards at the same time so that they are face up. Only flip the top card. Other cards must remain secret.
